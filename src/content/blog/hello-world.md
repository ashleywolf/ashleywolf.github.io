## `$ echo "hello, world"`

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Ashley, and this is my blog.

I built this site because I wanted a place to write about the things I'm learning and building — mostly around **open source**, **developer tools**, and **agentic workflows**. I work in developer relations, and I think a lot about how to make developers' lives easier.

## Why open source?

This entire blog is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/ashleywolf/ashleywolf.github.io). You can see every commit, every design decision, every typo I've fixed. Writing a new post is just adding a markdown file and pushing to `main`.

I believe in building in the open. If something I write or build helps someone else, that's a win.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Open source** — contributing, maintaining, and building communities
- **Dev tools** — the tools I use and the ones I'm building
- **Agentic workflows** — AI-powered automation for developers
- **Random experiments** — whatever I'm hacking on at 2am

Stay tuned. Or don't — I'll be here either way, shouting into the void. 🐺

```bash
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ git push origin main
```
